      // When we reassigned and changed the value of a[2] in the function, the global var 'a' that was passed also reflected the 
      // change since it and the local variable 'a' both point to the same refernce.
      
      // further explanation:
      // if we add one more line:
      // var anotherArr = a;
      // console.log(anotherArr) logs out [1, 2, 10] after we call myValue(a);
