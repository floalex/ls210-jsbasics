      // It prints out undefined. With hoisting(lifted and declared), the code above equals to below:
      // var a;
      // console.log(a);
      
      // var a = 1;
      // var a was actually decalred with undefined value so undefeined was logged. Value of 1 
      // assigned to 'a' after console.log performed.
      // It is important to know that only variable declarations are hoisted to the top, not variable initialization or assignments
