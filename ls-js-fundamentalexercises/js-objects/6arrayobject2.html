    // Value 10 is returned from above code. The length of the array is 2 as myArray[-1] and myArray[-1] don't count in the array's length.
    // so in line 21 the calculation 20 / 2 = 10 performed.
    
    // If we want the average function to return value 5, we can change the var i value to 0 and start summing up from the first value in the array.
