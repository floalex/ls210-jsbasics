    //The penultimate function returns the next to last word in the String passed to it as an argument. The function assumens that Words 
    //are any sequence of non-blank characters. It also assumes that the input String will always contain at least two words. Currently, the 
    // solution provided does not match what is expected. Run the program, check the current result, identify the problem, explain what the 
    // problem is, and provide a working solution.
    
    // penultimate('last word')               // 'last'
    // penultimate('Launch School is great!') // 'is'
    
    // function penultimate(string) {
    //   return string.split(' ')[-2];
    // }
    
    // Unlike Ruby, negative index in Arrays in JavaScript will not count backward. By passing in -1 we are actually ask JavaScript to return 
    // the value of the property with -1 as the key.
    // In order to work expected, we can add the slice function like below:
    
    console.log(penultimate('last word'));               // 'last'
    console.log(penultimate('Launch School is great!')); // 'is'
    
    function penultimate(string) {
      return string.split(' ').slice(-2, -1);
    }
    
    // As a negative index, begin indicates an offset from the end of the sequence. slice(-2) extracts the last two elements in the sequence;
    // end indicates an offset from the end of the sequence. slice(-2,-1) extracts the second-to-last element through the second-to-last 
    // element in the sequence(slice extracts up to but not including end).
