    // The 'prop2' in line19 is different from the one in var myObject. In line 22, we actually access the prop2 inmyObject this time. The value is
    // reassigned to '456' in line18 so we get '456' in line22.

    console.log(myObj);
    
    // {funcProp: "hello, "} and  {funcProp: "world!"}.
    // The property name is decalred as 'funcProp' in line34 in the myFunc(). The value is assigned to 'hello, ' in line32.
    // Thus line37 logs out the the value in line32. After that, we reassign the value to 'world!', so line39 logs out with this new value.
