      // Both two logs print out [1, 2, 3].
      // If we add console.log(myArray) on top of each console.log(myOtherArray), we can better understand what happened:
    
      // In JavaScript, objects(such as arrays) are stored as a reference and not the actual value. 
      // We copied the myArry object to myOtherArry. But when we changed myArray with pop() function, 
      // the change reflected on the myOtherArray.
      
      // Later, we reassign myArray to a different array [1, 2] with '='(reassignment operation) and now it points to a different reference.
      // Thus myArray and myOtherArray have different references.
