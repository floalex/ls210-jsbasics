    // The oddities function returns an Array that contains every other element of an Array that is passed in as an argument. The values in 
    // the returned list are those values that are in the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and so on elements of the argument Array. Below is a sample run of the 
    // program that makes use of the output as part of a comparison. Can you explain the results of the comparison?

    // The results for the comparison are false because they are two different arrays that happen to contain the same three values. When the === comparison operator used
    // with arrays, it actually checks if they are the same object, not if they have the same value.
