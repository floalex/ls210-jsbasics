    // Create a simple tip calculator. The program should prompt for a bill amount and a tip rate. The program must compute the tip and 
    // then display both the tip and the total amount of the bill. You can ignore input validation and assume that the user will put in numbers.
    
    // Example:
    // What is the bill? 200
    // What is the tip percentage? 15
    
    // The tip is $30.0
    // The total is $230.0
    
    var bill = prompt('What is the bill?');
    var percentage = prompt('What is the tip percentage?');
    
    var tip = (bill * (percentage / 100));
    var total = (parseFloat(bill) + tip);
    
    console.log('The tip is $' + tip.toFixed(1));
    console.log('The total is $' + total.toFixed(1));
