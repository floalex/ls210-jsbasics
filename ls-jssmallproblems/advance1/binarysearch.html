      // One of the common things done with data is searching it. Imagine that you 
      // have a yellow pages and you were searching for a particular business. A 
      // straightforward search would be to scroll through the yellow pages one page 
      // at a time and check if the business name you're looking for is in it. Its 
      // simple and easy to do however, at the worst case, it could mean going over 
      // through the end of yellow pages if the business name, for instance, began 
      // with a letter z. While, it is simple, it is not efficient.

      // An alternative to this "linear search", is a binary search algorithm. 
      // The basic idea of this algorithm is to cut the search area in half at every 
      // iteration by discarding the half that the value searched for does not exist 
      // in. The binary search algorithm does this by relying on the data being 
      // "sorted". Going back to the yellow pages, example. Lets say that 
      // we're looking for "Pizzeria".

      // Example:
      
      // //Yellow pages list of businesses data:
      // var yellowPages = ['Apple Store', 'Bags Galor', 'Bike Store',
      //   'Donuts R Us', 'Eat a Lot', 'Good Food', 'Pasta place',
      //   'Pizzeria', 'Ruby Lounge', 'Zooper'];
      // With a linear search, we will go through each of the items in turn until 
      // the search item, Pizzeria is found. In a binary search, the following sequence will happen:
      
      // Get to the half of the data (assume truncation) --> Eat a Lot
      // If the value at the half is equal to Pizzeria stop the search.
      // If the value at the half is less than Pizzeria:
      // Discard the lower half including the value at the half 
      //   --> ['Apple Store', 'Bags Galor', 'Bike Store', 'Donuts R Us', 'Eat a Lot']
      // Repeat the process from the top, using the upper half 
      //   --> ['Good Food', 'Pasta place', 'Pizzeria', 'Ruby Lounge', 'Zooper']
      // If the value at the half is greater than Pizzeria, do the same as previous 
      // but reverse the halves.
      // With the above described process, the search will end with the next 
      // iteration since the value at the half is already Pizzeria.
      
      // Implement a binarySearch function that takes an array and searchItem as 
      // arguments and returns the index if it is found and -1 otherwise. 
      // You may assume that the array passed in will always be sorted.
      
      function binarySearch(array, searchItem) {
        var high = array.length - 1;
        var low = 0;
        
        while (low <= high) {
          var mid = Math.floor((high + low) / 2);
          if (array[mid] === searchItem) {
            return mid;
          } else if (array[mid] < searchItem) {
            low = mid + 1;
          } else {
            high = mid - 1;
          }
        }
        
        return -1;
      }
      
      console.log(binarySearch([1, 5, 7, 11, 23, 45, 65, 89, 102], 77));                                // -1
      console.log(binarySearch([1, 5, 7, 11, 23, 45, 65, 89, 102], 89));                                // 7
      console.log(binarySearch(['Alice', 'Bonnie', 'Kim', 'Pete', 'Rachel', 'Sue', 'Tyler'], 'Peter')); // -1
      console.log(binarySearch(['Alice', 'Bonnie', 'Kim', 'Pete', 'Rachel', 'Sue', 'Tyler'], 'Tyler')); // 6
