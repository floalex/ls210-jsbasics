      // Make a madlibs program that takes a text template as input, and then plugs 
      // in a selection of randomized nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs into that 
      // text and prints it. You can build your lists of nouns, verbs, adjectives, 
      // and adverbs directly into your program. Your program should read this text, 
      // and for each line, it should place random words of the appropriate types 
      // into the text, and print the result.

      // The challenge of this program isn't just about writing your solution; it's 
      // about choosing the structure of the text template. Choose the right way to 
      // structure your template, and this problem becomes a whole lot easier. 
      // Consequently, this exercise is a bit more open ended since the input is 
      // also something that you will be defining.
      
      // To find the words, there has to be identifiers that denote its start and end. 
      // These identifiers also have to be unique enough that the function won't 
      // mistake normal text as a "token" to replace

                '${verb} the ${adjective} yellow ' +
                '${noun}, who ${adverb} ${verb} his ' +
                '${noun} and looks around.';

      var template2 = 'The ${noun} ${verb} the ${noun}\'s ${noun}.';
